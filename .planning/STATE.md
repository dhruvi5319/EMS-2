## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Layered monolith (React + Node.js REST API + PostgreSQL) — avoids microservices complexity for single-tenant scope
- [Init]: JWT/session-cookie hybrid with DB-stored session hash for revocability
- [Init]: Granularity set to "standard" — 6 phases derived from gate progression (F0–F1 → F0 shell → F2–F3 → F4–F7 → F8–F10 → F11–F14)
- [Init]: F0 split across Phase 1 (auth/session infrastructure) and Phase 2 (full shell/nav/search/audit UI) to respect dependency order
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Backend fail-fast env validation: requireEnv() throws at startup if DATABASE_URL or JWT_SECRET missing — prevents silent misconfiguration in any environment
- [Phase 01-foundation]: docker-compose frontend uses stock node:20-alpine image (no custom Dockerfile) — simpler for dev; backend uses custom Dockerfile with build context
- [Phase 01-02]: Two-migration split (auth in 001, core domain in 002) — allows Plan 01-03 auth endpoints to reference users/sessions tables independently
- [Phase 01-02]: knexfile.ts uses extension: 'ts' for dev migrations, 'js' for production (post-compile) — avoids tsx in production containers
- [Phase 01-foundation]: bcryptjs over bcrypt: pure JavaScript, avoids Alpine Linux native module compilation in Docker containers
- [Phase 01-foundation]: DB session hash over stateless JWT: session_hash in sessions table enables per-session revocation via DELETE on logout
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Generic 401 for both bad username and bad password: prevents user enumeration attacks
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Plain Tailwind CSS (no shadcn) for Phase 1 UI — shadcn_initialized: false per UI-SPEC; tokens pre-aligned for seamless Phase 2 migration
- [Phase 01-foundation]: AuthContext restores session on mount via GET /api/auth/me — eliminates re-login on page reload
- [Phase 01-foundation]: E2E Playwright tests written as artifacts; execution deferred to verify phase (requires full running stack)
- [Phase 02-application-shell]: shadcn CLI had ECONNRESET network failure — components manually written from official new-york templates to ensure exact contract parity
- [Phase 02-application-shell]: CSS variable token pattern established: --primary: 221 83% 53% in :root, consumed as hsl(var(--primary)) in Tailwind theme extension
- [Phase 02-application-shell]: RoleGuard renders ForbiddenPage in-place (not redirect to /403) — URL stays, sidebar/topbar remain visible, matches UI-SPEC Screen E
- [Phase 02-application-shell]: NAV_SECTIONS empty allowedRoles[] = all roles allowed — avoids enumerating 8 roles for Dashboard/Engagements sections
- [Phase 02-application-shell]: Search scoping: non-AD users only see engagements with team_assignments; AD users see all — enforced in service layer via whereIn subquery
- [Phase 02-application-shell]: User deactivation invalidates all sessions (DELETE FROM sessions WHERE user_id=?) to prevent continued access
- [Phase 02-application-shell]: GlobalSearchBar overlay open state: open && query.length > 0 — empty input closes overlay without extra logic
- [Phase 02-application-shell]: shadcn Command component used for search overlay — provides keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Enter, Escape) out of the box
- [Phase 02-application-shell]: E2E search tests written as artifacts; browser execution deferred to verify phase per test execution boundary
- [Phase 02-application-shell]: UserTable onActivate prop takes userId string for consistent direct hook call pattern
- [Phase 02-application-shell]: E2E user management tests written as artifacts; browser execution deferred to verify phase
- [Phase 02-application-shell]: Filter draft state in AuditTrailFilters component committed on Apply — prevents premature re-fetching
- [Phase 02-application-shell]: actor_roles parsed defensively with Array.isArray + JSON.parse fallback for array/string API formats
- [Phase 03-intake-and-gate-a1]: Multer memory storage: buffer passes directly to StorageProvider.save() — avoids temp file cleanup complexity
- [Phase 03-intake-and-gate-a1]: Submit validation returns 422 with fields array — frontend can highlight specific missing fields
- [Phase 03-intake-and-gate-a1]: gate_decisions.engagement_id is NOT NULL — decline path returns synthetic GateDecision, not a DB row; approve path stores real row with engagement_id FK
- [Phase 03-intake-and-gate-a1]: No engagement_number serial in DB schema — job code sequence uses COUNT(engagements)+1 within transaction for ENG-YYYY-NNNNN format
- [Phase 03-intake-and-gate-a1]: audit_events uses object_type/object_id/after_state JSONB instead of entity_type/metadata — actor_roles stored in after_state JSON
- [Phase 03-intake-and-gate-a1]: IntakeFileUpload uses raw fetch() for FormData multipart — api.ts forces Content-Type: application/json which breaks file uploads
- [Phase 03-intake-and-gate-a1]: shadcn registry unavailable (ECONNRESET) — components written manually from official new-york templates, same as Phase 2
- [Phase 03-intake-and-gate-a1]: data-section=gate-a1 slot in RequestDetailPage: Plan 03-05 injects GateA1Panel via this anchor point
- [Phase 03-intake-and-gate-a1]: react-day-picker v10 API used: Chevron component instead of IconLeft/IconRight; initialFocus removed
- [Phase 03-intake-and-gate-a1]: zod v4 API: z.date().optional() + runtime check instead of required_error parameter (removed in v4)
- [Phase 03-intake-and-gate-a1]: GateA1DecidedCard uses status-based placeholder for Phase 3 — Phase 4 will add dedicated gate_decision API fetch
- [Phase 04-engagement-setup-and-gate-p2]: gate_decisions queried by engagement_id only (A1 stored with engagement_id after approval, no request_id column in schema)
- [Phase 04-engagement-setup-and-gate-p2]: engagementsRouter coexists with auditRouter at /api/engagements — no conflict (different sub-paths)
- [Phase 04-engagement-setup-and-gate-p2]: teamRouter mounted in routes/index.ts at /engagements/:id (not nested in engagements.ts) for simplicity
- [Phase 04-engagement-setup-and-gate-p2]: 8th P2 prerequisite (independence_status_complete) queries independence_affirmations with try/catch fallback for Plan 04-03 cross-dependency
- [Phase 04-engagement-setup-and-gate-p2]: Milestone status computed on read from target_date vs today — not stored in DB — status stays accurate without triggers
- [Phase 04-engagement-setup-and-gate-p2]: Adapted planning service to actual DB schema: objectives table (not planning_record_objectives), gate_decisions uses gate_type/status (not gate_name/decision), no independence_affirmations table
- [Phase 04-engagement-setup-and-gate-p2]: requestRevision reverts planning_record to draft status to properly unlock editing (plan spec said status unchanged but that contradicts the unlock requirement)
- [Phase 04-engagement-setup-and-gate-p2]: card.tsx written manually from new-york template (shadcn registry ECONNRESET) — same pattern as Phases 2/3
- [Phase 04-engagement-setup-and-gate-p2]: GateStatusCard: outcome-to-border-color map (emerald/amber/red/yellow/slate) established as reusable pattern for all gate displays
- [Phase 04-engagement-setup-and-gate-p2]: canRemove() guard passed as prop from TeamPanel to TeamMemberTable — centralizes guard logic, decouples rendering
- [Phase 04-engagement-setup-and-gate-p2]: TeamPanel receives p2Approved from EngagementShellPage gate_decisions — avoids extra API call in TeamPanel
- [Phase 04-engagement-setup-and-gate-p2]: Independence affirmation uses RadioGroup with 3 values (affirmed/pending/exception_noted) NOT boolean Switch — per UI-SPEC IndependenceStatusRadio component
- [Phase 04-engagement-setup-and-gate-p2]: setIndependenceStatus is a client-side stub — no backend independence_affirmations route exists; P2 prerequisite check uses try/catch fallback
- [Phase 04-engagement-setup-and-gate-p2]: P2ReadinessChecklist uses refreshTrigger numeric prop to force reload after parent form saves (draft save, objective add, etc.)
- [Phase 04-engagement-setup-and-gate-p2]: isQA prop declared in PlanningRecordPanelProps for Plan 04-07 forward compatibility; unused in this plan
- [Phase 04-engagement-setup-and-gate-p2]: GateP2ReviewPanel conditionally rendered in PlanningRecordPanel (isQA && status=ready_for_review) — avoids separate route, reuses existing data flow
- [Phase 04-engagement-setup-and-gate-p2]: AlertDialog custom buttons (not AlertDialogAction/Cancel) to support async loading states — prevents auto-close before loading spinner completes
- [Phase 05-evidence-findings-and-gate-p3]: Adapted to actual DB schema: evidence_files uses evidence_id/file_ref/filename; mapped in toEvidenceFile() to preserve EvidenceFile interface contract
- [Phase 05-evidence-findings-and-gate-p3]: canViewRestricted(roles) checks PRIVILEGED_ROLES set [AN,EM,QA,IR,PC,AD] — AL/RO excluded from restricted evidence items in listEvidence and getEvidenceFile
- [Phase 05-evidence-findings-and-gate-p3]: Gate P3 routes on engagementsRouter (not findingsRouter) to avoid /:finding_id path conflict with /gate/p3/prerequisites
- [Phase 05-evidence-findings-and-gate-p3]: finding_evidence_links uses evidence_id FK (not evidence_item_id per spec) — matched actual migration 002 schema
- [Phase 05-evidence-findings-and-gate-p3]: objectivecoverage.service.ts created in plan 05-03 as blocking dependency for checkP3Prerequisites (plan 05-02 not yet executed)
- [Phase 05-evidence-findings-and-gate-p3]: sufficiency_status stored on objectives table (migration 003) — no separate objective_sufficiency table; objective_evidence_links uses evidence_id (not evidence_item_id) per actual schema
- [Phase 05-evidence-findings-and-gate-p3]: linkEvidenceToObjectives accepts actorId to populate linked_by NOT NULL column in objective_evidence_links
- [Phase 05-evidence-findings-and-gate-p3]: shadcn registry ECONNRESET (consistent with Phases 2-4) — tooltip.tsx and sheet.tsx written manually from official new-york templates
- [Phase 05-evidence-findings-and-gate-p3]: Sheet component wraps @radix-ui/react-dialog — @radix-ui/react-sheet does not exist as npm package; shadcn Sheet is dialog + slide-in CSS variants
- [Phase 05-evidence-findings-and-gate-p3]: EvidenceFileUpload uses raw fetch() for FormData multipart (same as IntakeFileUpload Phase 3); api.ts Content-Type: application/json breaks file uploads
- [Phase 05-evidence-findings-and-gate-p3]: SufficiencyChip created as Rule 3 auto-fix (Plan 05-05 was skipped; required import for ObjectiveSufficiencySummary)
- [Phase 05-evidence-findings-and-gate-p3]: Added GET /evidence/:evidence_id endpoint (missing from Plan 05-01) — needed for EvidenceDetailPage
- [Phase 05-evidence-findings-and-gate-p3]: GapObjectiveCard uses onLinkClick callback (not embedded LinkObjectivePopover) — parent context determines link target
- [Phase 05-evidence-findings-and-gate-p3]: E2E tests for evidence-detail.spec.ts written as artifacts; execution deferred to verify phase
- [Phase 05-evidence-findings-and-gate-p3]: P3DecisionPanel uses aria-disabled + Tooltip wrapper on Approve P3 button (not HTML disabled) — allows tooltip on disabled state per UI-SPEC
- [Phase 05-evidence-findings-and-gate-p3]: Post-P3-approval green banner uses react-router location state (p3Approved: true) read in EngagementShellPage on mount; dismissed by local state
- [Phase 05-evidence-findings-and-gate-p3]: Phase 5 human verification passed — all 31 steps confirmed, Phase 6 unblocked
- [Phase 06-draft-reference-check-gate-p4-and-dashboard]: Statements adapted to actual DB schema: draft_product_id FK bridge (not direct engagement_id), display_order, no waived/assigned_back_to columns; STATEMENT_DISCREPANCY_ASSIGNED audit event uses action/object_type/after_state pattern
- [Phase 06-draft-reference-check-gate-p4-and-dashboard]: /export placeholder registered BEFORE /:id in engagements.ts to prevent parameterized route capture — pattern for all future /export routes
- [Phase 06-draft-reference-check-gate-p4-and-dashboard]: Adapted to actual 002 migration schema: draft_file_ref/draft_filename columns; draft_comments uses draft_product_id/commented_by/commented_at
- [Phase 06-draft-reference-check-gate-p4-and-dashboard]: QA Return-to-Drafting (under_review→drafting) enforced at route layer; ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS kept clean in service
- [Phase 06-draft-reference-check-gate-p4-and-dashboard]: P4 outcome 'ready_for_issuance' maps to engagement.phase='readiness'; 'closed' maps to phase='closed'+status='closed'
- [Phase 06-draft-reference-check-gate-p4-and-dashboard]: draft_statements queried via draft_products FK (no direct engagement_id) — P4 prerequisites check joins through draft_products
- [Phase 06-draft-reference-check-gate-p4-and-dashboard]: DraftStatusStepper is pure Tailwind (no shadcn stepper) — 4-step nodes with CheckCircle for completed, number for active/upcoming
- [Phase 06-draft-reference-check-gate-p4-and-dashboard]: useDraftProduct uses raw fetch() for FormData file upload, api.ts for all other calls — consistent with Phase 3/5 pattern
- [Phase 06-draft-reference-check-gate-p4-and-dashboard]: StatementDetailPage uses GET list endpoint + client-side filter (no single-statement GET in backend); team API shape is {assignments} grouped by user_id for multi-role users
