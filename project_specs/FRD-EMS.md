# Functional Requirements Document (FRD)
## Lightweight Engagement Management System (EMS)

**Project Acronym:** EMS  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-06-04  
**Status:** Active  
**Source PRD:** PRD-EMS.md v1.0  

---

## Scope Statement

This FRD specifies the functional behavior of every feature in the EMS MVP (Features F0–F17). It transforms the product requirements defined in PRD-EMS.md into implementation-ready specifications covering inputs, outputs, validation rules, error handling, role-based access control, database schema, and REST API contracts. Developers must be able to implement each feature from the corresponding chunk without ambiguity or additional requirements discovery.

---

## How to Read This Document

- **Feature chunks** (`F00`–`F17`) each cover one PRD feature with description, terminology, sub-features, process, inputs, outputs, validation, error states, per-feature API summary, and per-feature schema surface.
- **Cross-feature chunks** (`Y0`–`Y3`) consolidate the full database DDL, REST API catalog, cross-feature error catalog, and integration points.
- **Feature IDs** use zero-padded two-digit numbers (`F00`, `F01`, …, `F17`) to match PRD feature IDs `F0`–`F17`.
- **Gate IDs** follow PRD naming: `A1`, `P2`, `P3`, `P4`.
- **Role abbreviations** used in permission tables:

| Abbreviation | Role |
|---|---|
| AL | Engagement Acceptance Lead |
| EM | Engagement Manager |
| AN | Analyst |
| QA | QA Reviewer |
| IR | Independent Referencer |
| PC | Publishing Coordinator |
| RO | Read-Only Stakeholder |
| AD | Admin |

- **HTTP method conventions:** `GET` = read, `POST` = create, `PUT` = replace, `PATCH` = partial update, `DELETE` = remove.
- **Validation failure response:** HTTP 422 with an `errors` array unless a different code is specified.
- **Authorization failure response:** HTTP 403 with error code `FORBIDDEN`.
- **Authentication failure response:** HTTP 401 with error code `UNAUTHORIZED`.

## Shared Cross-Cutting Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Engagement** | A structured body of work performed in response to a request, mandate, or internal decision. |
| **Request** | The intake record that initiates the engagement workflow. |
| **Engagement Shell** | The main record for an accepted engagement, including metadata, phase, status, owner, team, milestones, and artifacts. |
| **Gate A1** | Acceptance approval gate. Passing A1 creates an engagement shell. |
| **Gate P2** | Planning approval gate. Passing P2 locks the lightweight planning baseline. |
| **Gate P3** | Evidence readiness gate. Passing P3 confirms evidence is sufficient to proceed to draft readiness work. |
| **Gate P4** | Final readiness gate. Passing P4 confirms reference checks and final review are complete. |
| **Planning Baseline** | The approved set of objectives, design approach, schedule, risk notes, data reliability notes, and independence affirmations locked by Gate P2. |
| **Objective** | A research question or work objective that evidence and findings must support. |
| **Evidence Item** | A document, dataset, interview note, or other item collected to support engagement objectives. |
| **Finding** | A draft conclusion or observation supported by evidence. |
| **Draft Product** | A working report or product record prepared from findings and reviewed before final readiness. |
| **Indexing** | Linking a draft statement or finding to supporting evidence. |
| **Reference Check** | Independent verification that an indexed statement is supported by the linked evidence. |
| **Audit Event** | A timestamped, immutable record of an important action: approval, status change, upload, or review decision. |
| **Blocker** | Any condition that prevents a gate from passing or a phase from advancing. |
| **Restricted Evidence** | Evidence flagged as sensitive; visible only to authorized roles assigned to the engagement. |
| **RBAC** | Role-Based Access Control — the authorization model governing all create/read/update/delete operations. |
| **Gate Decision** | The formal record of a gate outcome: gate type, status (Approved/Declined/Returned), approver, timestamp, rationale. |

## F00: Basic Application Shell

**Description:** The application shell is the authenticated web container that all other features live within. It provides login/logout, navigation, role assignment, and audit trail viewing. Every feature in the EMS depends on the shell to enforce authentication before rendering any page or accepting any API request.

**Terminology:**
- **Session:** An authenticated user context established after login; stored as a server-side session or JWT.
- **Navigation Rail/Sidebar:** The persistent UI element listing top-level sections: Dashboard, Requests, Engagements, Evidence, Review Queue, Reports.
- **Search Bar:** A global text input that queries across engagement ID, title, requester, phase, and owner.
- **Review Queue:** A filtered list of items awaiting the current user's action (gate approvals, reference checks, returns).

**Sub-features:**
- F00.1 — Login and logout
- F00.2 — User role assignment (Admin only)
- F00.3 — Main navigation
- F00.4 — Global search
- F00.5 — Audit trail view per engagement

---

### F00.1 Login and Logout

**Process:**
1. Unauthenticated user navigates to any protected route.
2. System redirects to the login page.
3. User submits username and password (or org identity provider flow).
4. System validates credentials.
5. On success: system creates a session, records login audit event, redirects to Dashboard.
6. On failure: system increments failed-login counter; after 5 consecutive failures within 15 minutes, locks account for 15 minutes and writes audit event.
7. User clicks Logout; system destroys session and redirects to login page.

**Inputs:**
- `username` (string, required): user's email address
- `password` (string, required): user's password

**Outputs:**
- Authenticated session (cookie or JWT) with `user_id`, `role`, `name`
- Redirect to `/dashboard`

**Validation:**
- `username` must be non-empty and valid email format.
- `password` must be non-empty.
- Credentials must match a known active user account.

**Error States:**

| Scenario | HTTP | Code | Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| Invalid credentials | 401 | `AUTH_INVALID` | "Invalid username or password." |
| Account locked | 403 | `AUTH_LOCKED` | "Account locked due to repeated failures. Try again in 15 minutes." |
| Missing username or password | 422 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | Field-level errors array |

---

### F00.2 User Role Assignment

**Process:**
1. Admin navigates to User Management.
2. Admin selects a user and assigns one or more roles from the predefined list.
3. System saves the role assignment and writes an audit event.
4. New permissions take effect on the user's next request (or immediately if session is refreshed).

**Inputs:**
- `user_id` (UUID, required)
- `roles` (array of role codes, required): one or more of `AL`, `EM`, `AN`, `QA`, `IR`, `PC`, `RO`, `AD`

**Validation:**
- At least one role must be assigned.
- Role codes must be from the predefined list.
- Only Admin may invoke this action.

---

### F00.3 Main Navigation

The navigation rail exposes these top-level sections to all authenticated users:

| Section | Route | Visible To |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard | `/dashboard` | All |
| Requests | `/requests` | AL, EM, AD, RO |
| Engagements | `/engagements` | All |
| Evidence | `/evidence` | AN, QA, EM, IR, AD, RO |
| Review Queue | `/review-queue` | AL, QA, IR, PC, EM |
| Reports | `/reports` | All |

Sections not visible to a role are hidden; direct URL access to a hidden section returns HTTP 403.

---

### F00.4 Global Search

**Inputs:**
- `q` (string, required): search query, minimum 2 characters

**Search targets:** engagement ID (exact), engagement title (contains), requester name (contains), phase (exact), owner name (contains)

**Outputs:**
- Ranked list of matching engagements (max 50 results)
- Each result: engagement ID, title, phase, owner, status

**Validation:**
- Query must be ≥2 characters.
- Results filtered to engagements the current user is authorized to view.

---

### F00.5 Audit Trail View

**Process:**
1. User with authorized role navigates to Engagement → Audit Trail tab.
2. System retrieves all audit events for the engagement, ordered by timestamp descending.
3. User can filter by action type and date range.

**Outputs:**
- List of audit events: timestamp, actor name, action, object type, object ID, summary

**Access control:** All roles assigned to an engagement may view its audit trail. Admin may view all audit trails.

---

**API Surface (F00):** see `Y1-api.md` §Auth and §Users for full request/response schemas.

**Schema Surface (F00):** uses tables `users`, `user_roles`, `sessions` — see `Y0-schema.md` §Auth.
---

## F01: Core Data Objects

**Description:** Core Data Objects defines the ten persistent entities that form the backbone of the EMS data model. Every feature creates, reads, updates, or relates these objects. This feature specifies the canonical fields, data types, allowed values, and integrity constraints for each entity. The full DDL is in `Y0-schema.md`.

**Terminology:**
- **UUID:** Universally Unique Identifier used as primary key for all entities.
- **Enum field:** A column whose value must be drawn from a fixed allowed-values list defined here.
- **Foreign key (FK):** A field referencing the primary key of another entity; the referenced record must exist.
- **Soft delete:** Records are marked `deleted_at` rather than physically removed; this preserves audit and gate history.

**Sub-features:**
- F01.1 — Request entity
- F01.2 — Engagement entity
- F01.3 — Team Assignment entity
- F01.4 — Planning Record entity
- F01.5 — Objective entity
- F01.6 — Evidence Item entity
- F01.7 — Finding entity
- F01.8 — Draft Product entity
- F01.9 — Gate Decision entity
- F01.10 — Audit Event entity

## F02: Request Intake

**Description:** Request Intake allows an Engagement Acceptance Lead to create, edit, and submit a formal request record. The request is the entry point to the entire engagement lifecycle. It must capture sufficient information for an informed acceptance decision at Gate A1. Requests may be saved as drafts and submitted only when all required fields are present.

**Terminology:**
- **Draft status:** The request has been saved but not yet submitted for A1 review.
- **Submitted status:** The request has passed local validation and is queued for A1 decision.
- **Intake document:** A single file attachment (e.g., congressional letter, mandate memo, or internal proposal document) uploaded alongside the request record.

**Sub-features:**
- F02.1 — Create request (Draft)
- F02.2 — Edit request (Draft only)
- F02.3 — Submit request
- F02.4 — Upload intake document
- F02.5 — View request detail

---

### F02.1 Create Request

**Roles permitted:** AL, AD

**Process:**
1. Authorized user navigates to Requests → New Request.
2. User fills in required and optional fields.
3. User clicks "Save as Draft."
4. System validates required fields for draft (only `request_type` required at save-as-draft).
5. System creates the request record with `status = draft`.
6. System writes an audit event: action `REQUEST_CREATED`.
7. System redirects to the request detail page.

**Inputs:**
- `request_type` (enum, required): `congressional_request` | `mandate` | `internal_proposal`
- `requester` (string ≤255, required for submit): requester name or organization
- `topic` (string ≤500, required for submit): brief description of the engagement topic
- `agency_program` (string ≤255, required for submit): agency or program name
- `due_date` (date, required for submit): YYYY-MM-DD format; past dates are permitted (mandates may have retrospective dates); system shows a warning if the date is in the past but does not block submission
- `notes` (string, optional): free-text notes, max 5000 characters

**Outputs:**
- Created `Request` record with `status = draft`
- Audit event `REQUEST_CREATED`

---

### F02.2 Edit Request

**Roles permitted:** AL, AD (only while `status = draft`)

**Process:**
1. User navigates to request detail and clicks Edit.
2. System confirms `status = draft`; if not, edit is blocked.
3. User modifies fields and saves.
4. System validates and updates the record.
5. System writes audit event `REQUEST_UPDATED`.

**Validation:**
- Editing is blocked if `status` is `submitted`, `accepted`, or `declined`.
- Any field may be updated while in draft status.

**Error States:**

| Scenario | HTTP | Code | Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| Edit attempted on submitted/accepted/declined request | 409 | `REQUEST_NOT_EDITABLE` | "Request cannot be edited after submission." |
| Unauthorized role | 403 | `FORBIDDEN` | "You do not have permission to edit requests." |

---

### F02.3 Submit Request

**Roles permitted:** AL, AD

**Process:**
1. User clicks "Submit" on a draft request.
2. System runs full validation against all required-for-submit fields.
3. If validation fails: system returns 422 with field-level errors; status remains `draft`.
4. If validation passes: system sets `status = submitted`, records `submitted_at` timestamp.
5. System writes audit event `REQUEST_SUBMITTED`.
6. Request becomes visible in the A1 Review Queue.

**Validation (all required for submit):**
- `request_type` must be a valid enum value.
- `requester` must be non-empty, ≤255 characters.
- `topic` must be non-empty, ≤500 characters.
- `agency_program` must be non-empty, ≤255 characters.
- `due_date` must be present and a valid date (past dates are permitted since mandates may have retrospective dates, but system must warn if due date is in the past).
- If intake document was uploaded, file reference must be stored successfully before submit can proceed.

**Error States:**

| Scenario | HTTP | Code | Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| Required fields missing | 422 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | Per-field errors array |
| Already submitted | 409 | `REQUEST_ALREADY_SUBMITTED` | "Request has already been submitted." |
| Unauthorized role | 403 | `FORBIDDEN` | "You do not have permission to submit requests." |

---

### F02.4 Upload Intake Document

**Roles permitted:** AL, AD (while `status = draft` or during editing before submission)

**Process:**
1. User selects a file using the file picker on the request form.
2. System validates file type and size.
3. System stores the file in file storage under path `requests/{request_id}/{filename}`.
4. System records `intake_document_ref` and `intake_document_name` on the request record.
5. Only one intake document is allowed; uploading a new file replaces the previous one.
6. System writes audit event `REQUEST_DOCUMENT_UPLOADED`.

**File Constraints:**
- **Allowed types:** PDF, DOCX, DOC, XLSX, XLS, TXT, PNG, JPG, JPEG
- **Maximum file size:** 25 MB
- **One file per request** (replacing an existing upload is allowed while in draft status)

## F03: Acceptance Decision — Gate A1

**Description:** Gate A1 is the first formal governance checkpoint in the engagement lifecycle. An Engagement Acceptance Lead reviews a submitted request, records a risk level assessment, and either approves or declines the engagement. On approval, the system automatically creates an Engagement Shell (F04 record) and transitions the request to Accepted status. On decline, the request is closed with a recorded rationale. All A1 decisions create an immutable audit event and a Gate Decision record.

**Terminology:**
- **A1 Approval:** The gate outcome that creates an engagement shell and sets request status to `accepted`.
- **A1 Decline:** The gate outcome that closes the request with rationale; sets request status to `declined`.
- **Risk Level:** A required assessment (`low`, `medium`, `high`) recorded alongside the A1 decision, copied to the Engagement record on approval.
- **Auto-creation:** The process by which the system creates the Engagement record without any additional user action after A1 approval.

**Sub-features:**
- F03.1 — Review submitted request for A1
- F03.2 — Approve request (Gate A1 pass)
- F03.3 — Decline request (Gate A1 fail)
- F03.4 — Auto-create engagement shell on approval
- F03.5 — A1 gate decision visibility

---

### F03.1 Review Submitted Request for A1

**Roles permitted:** AL only

**Process:**
1. AL navigates to Review Queue or Requests list; filters by `status = submitted`.
2. AL opens the request detail page.
3. System displays all request fields, intake document download link, and submission timestamp.
4. System confirms `status = submitted` before rendering A1 decision controls.

**Validation:**
- A1 decision controls must not be rendered if `status ≠ submitted`.
- Only users with role `AL` may see and use A1 decision controls.

---

### F03.2 Approve Request — Gate A1 Pass

**Roles permitted:** AL only

**Process:**
1. AL selects risk level (`low`, `medium`, or `high`) from the A1 form.
2. AL enters approval rationale (required).
3. AL clicks "Approve."
4. System validates prerequisites (see Prerequisite Rules below).
5. System creates a `GateDecision` record:  
   - `gate_type = A1`, `status = approved`, `approver_id`, `decided_at = now()`, `rationale`
6. System creates an `Engagement` record (auto-creation — see F03.4).
7. System updates request: `status = accepted`.
8. System writes audit event `GATE_A1_APPROVED`.
9. System redirects AL to the new Engagement Shell page.

**Prerequisite Validation Rules (all must pass before A1 approval):**
- `request.status` must be `submitted`.
- `request.request_type` must be non-null.
- `request.requester` must be non-null and non-empty.

**Inputs:**
- `request_id` (UUID, required)
- `risk_level` (enum, required): `low` | `medium` | `high`
- `rationale` (string, required, min 10 chars)

**Outputs:**
- `GateDecision` record (`status = approved`)
- `Engagement` record (new, `phase = planning`, `status = active`)
- `Request` record updated to `status = accepted`
- Audit event `GATE_A1_APPROVED`

**Error States:**

| Scenario | HTTP | Code | Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| Request not in `submitted` status | 409 | `GATE_PREREQUISITE_FAILED` | "Request must be in Submitted status to pass A1." |
| Required request fields missing | 422 | `GATE_FIELDS_INCOMPLETE` | "Request is missing required fields: [field list]." |
| Risk level not provided | 422 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | "Risk level is required for A1 approval." |
| Rationale too short | 422 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | "Rationale must be at least 10 characters." |
| Unauthorized role | 403 | `FORBIDDEN` | "Only an Engagement Acceptance Lead may approve A1." |
| Request already decided | 409 | `GATE_ALREADY_DECIDED` | "This request has already been accepted or declined." |

---

### F03.3 Decline Request — Gate A1 Fail

**Roles permitted:** AL only

**Process:**
1. AL enters decline rationale (required).
2. AL clicks "Decline."
3. System validates prerequisites.
4. System creates a `GateDecision` record:  
   - `gate_type = A1`, `status = declined`, `approver_id`, `decided_at = now()`, `rationale`
5. System updates request: `status = declined`.
6. System writes audit event `GATE_A1_DECLINED`.
7. System displays confirmation and returns AL to the requests list.

**No engagement shell is created on decline.**

**Inputs:**
- `request_id` (UUID, required)
- `rationale` (string, required, min 10 chars)

**Validation:**
- `request.status` must be `submitted`.
- `rationale` must be non-empty, minimum 10 characters.

**Error States:**

| Scenario | HTTP | Code | Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| Request not in `submitted` status | 409 | `GATE_PREREQUISITE_FAILED` | "Request must be in Submitted status to decline." |
| Rationale missing or too short | 422 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | "Rationale must be at least 10 characters." |
| Unauthorized role | 403 | `FORBIDDEN` | "Only an Engagement Acceptance Lead may decline A1." |

---

### F03.4 Auto-Create Engagement Shell on Approval

**Triggered by:** Successful A1 approval (F03.2)

**Engagement record created with these initial values:**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `id` | System-generated UUID |
| `request_id` | FK to the approved request |
| `job_code` | Auto-generated from pattern `ENG-{YYYY}-{5-digit-sequence}` |
| `title` | Copied from `request.topic` (editable after creation) |
| `phase` | `planning` |
| `status` | `active` |
| `risk_level` | Value from A1 decision form |
| `owner_id` | Initially set to the approving AL user as a placeholder. The EM must reassign `owner_id` to a user with the EM role before Gate P2 can be submitted (the P2 prerequisite check requires a valid EM owner). The schema-level foreign key references `users.id` without a role constraint; the application layer enforces that `owner_id` references an active EM at edit time (F04.2) and at P2 submission (F06.4). |
| `portfolio` | null (set later in F04) |
| `created_at` | `now()` |

**Job code generation:** Sequence is per-year, zero-padded to 5 digits (e.g., `ENG-2026-00001`). If sequence generation fails, the transaction is rolled back and an error returned.

---

### F03.5 A1 Gate Decision Visibility

- The A1 gate decision is visible on:
  - The request detail page (decision summary card)
  - The Engagement Shell gate status section (once the engagement exists)
  - The Portfolio Dashboard gate status column
  - The Audit Trail for the engagement
- Gate decision history is preserved even if the engagement is later closed or archived.

## F04: Engagement Shell

**Description:** The Engagement Shell is the primary system-of-record page for an accepted engagement. It is created automatically at Gate A1 approval and serves as the hub that all downstream features (planning, evidence, findings, draft product, gate decisions) reference. Authorized roles can edit core metadata, view current gate status, see open blockers, and navigate to linked artifacts.

**Terminology:**
- **Metadata:** Core engagement fields: job code, title, phase, status, risk level, owner, portfolio.
- **Open Blocker:** Any condition that prevents the next gate from passing, displayed as a visible warning on the shell.
- **Gate Status Card:** A UI component showing the current outcome (Not Started / Approved / Declined / Returned) for each of A1, P2, P3, and P4.

**Sub-features:**
- F04.1 — View Engagement Shell
- F04.2 — Edit Engagement Metadata
- F04.3 — Display Gate Status Summary
- F04.4 — Display Open Blockers
- F04.5 — Navigate to Linked Artifacts

---

### F04.1 View Engagement Shell

**Roles permitted:** All roles assigned to the engagement; AD; RO (read only)

**Displayed fields:**
- Job code, title, phase, status badge, risk level badge
- Owner name and role
- Portfolio (if set)
- Created date
- Due date (from originating request, if applicable)
- Gate status cards: A1, P2, P3, P4 (each showing status, approver, date if decided)
- Open blockers list (see F04.4)
- Linked artifact counts: team members, objectives, evidence items, findings, draft product status

**Process:**
1. User navigates to `/engagements/{id}`.
2. System checks that the user is authorized to view this engagement (team assignment or Admin).
3. System loads all engagement fields, gate decisions, and artifact counts.
4. System renders the shell page.

**Error States:**

| Scenario | HTTP | Code | Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| Engagement not found | 404 | `NOT_FOUND` | "Engagement not found." |
| User not authorized for this engagement | 403 | `FORBIDDEN` | "You are not authorized to view this engagement." |

---

### F04.2 Edit Engagement Metadata

**Roles permitted:** EM, AD

**Editable fields:**
- `title` (string ≤500, required)
- `phase` (enum): system advances phase automatically at gates; manual override permitted by EM with a revision note
- `status` (enum): `active`, `on_hold`; `ready_for_issuance` and `closed` are set by gate outcomes only
- `risk_level` (enum): `low`, `medium`, `high`
- `owner_id` (UUID): reassign to another user with EM role
- `portfolio` (string ≤255, nullable)

**Process:**
1. EM navigates to Engagement Shell and clicks Edit.
2. EM modifies allowed fields.
3. EM clicks Save.
4. System validates inputs.
5. System saves changes and writes audit event `ENGAGEMENT_UPDATED`.

**Validation:**
- `title` must be non-empty.
- `phase` manual override requires a non-empty `revision_note` (minimum 10 characters).
- `owner_id` must reference an active user with `EM` role.
- `status` cannot be set to `ready_for_issuance` or `closed` through the edit form; those are gate-controlled.

**Error States:**

| Scenario | HTTP | Code | Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| Title empty | 422 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | "Title is required." |
| Invalid owner (not an EM) | 422 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | "Owner must be a user with the Engagement Manager role." |
| Attempting to set gate-controlled status | 422 | `STATUS_LOCKED` | "Status can only be set to Ready for Issuance or Closed through gate approval." |
| Unauthorized role | 403 | `FORBIDDEN` | "Only Engagement Managers may edit engagement metadata." |

---

### F04.3 Display Gate Status Summary

The shell must display a gate status card for each gate: A1, P2, P3, P4.

**Gate status card contents:**

| Field | Value when decided | Value when not yet decided |
|---|---|---|
| Gate label | `A1` / `P2` / `P3` / `P4` | same |
| Outcome | `Approved` / `Declined` / `Returned` | `Not Started` |
| Approver name | Recorded approver | — |
| Decision date | ISO date | — |
| Rationale preview | First 100 chars | — |

Gate status cards must remain visible even after the engagement transitions to a later phase. All gate history must be accessible via "View History" link showing all gate decisions for that gate type in reverse chronological order.

---

### F04.4 Display Open Blockers

Blockers are computed dynamically and displayed as a list on the shell. A blocker is any one of:

| Blocker Condition | Blocker Text |
|---|---|
| Planning record not in `approved` status | "Planning record is not approved (P2 required)." |
| Any objective with status `evidence_needed` | "Objective '{text}' has no linked evidence." |
| Any objective with status `in_review` (at P3) | "Objective '{text}' is still In Review." |
| Any finding with no linked evidence | "Finding '{text prefix}' has no linked evidence." |
| Any reference check in `in_review` or `failed` status | "Reference check for statement '{text prefix}' is {status}." |
| P3 not approved and draft product exists | "Gate P3 must be approved before P4 can proceed." |

The blockers list is empty when all prerequisites are met. A visible "No open blockers" message must appear when the list is empty.

---

### F04.5 Navigate to Linked Artifacts

The shell provides navigation links to:

| Section | Target |
|---|---|
| Team | `/engagements/{id}/team` (F05) |
| Planning Record | `/engagements/{id}/planning` (F06) |
| Evidence | `/engagements/{id}/evidence` (F08, F09) |
| Findings | `/engagements/{id}/findings` (F10) |
| Draft Product | `/engagements/{id}/draft` (F11, F12) |
| Gate History | `/engagements/{id}/gates` |
| Audit Trail | `/engagements/{id}/audit` |

## F05: Team and Milestones

**Description:** Team and Milestones allows the Engagement Manager to assign specific users to predefined engagement roles and to set target dates for key milestones. Role clarity is a prerequisite for Gate P2 approval (which requires the team to be assigned) and is the basis for routing actions and notifications throughout the engagement. Milestone dates provide the progress tracking visible in dashboards.

**Terminology:**
- **Team Assignment:** A record binding a user, a role, and an engagement.
- **Milestone:** A named target date for a key phase transition in the engagement lifecycle.
- **Milestone Status:** A computed or manually set state indicating whether the milestone is on track.

**Sub-features:**
- F05.1 — Assign team members
- F05.2 — Remove team members
- F05.3 — Set milestone dates
- F05.4 — View milestone status

---

### F05.1 Assign Team Members

**Roles permitted:** EM, AD

**Process:**
1. EM navigates to `/engagements/{id}/team`.
2. EM clicks "Add Team Member."
3. EM selects a user from the user list and assigns a role.
4. System validates the assignment (no duplicate role for same user on same engagement).
5. System creates a `TeamAssignment` record.
6. System writes audit event `TEAM_MEMBER_ASSIGNED`.

**Inputs:**
- `engagement_id` (UUID, required): derived from route
- `user_id` (UUID, required): must be an active user
- `role` (enum, required): `AL`, `EM`, `AN`, `QA`, `IR`, `PC`, `RO`

**Predefined role slots per engagement:**

| Role | Min | Max | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| EM (Engagement Manager) | 1 | 2 | Required; at least one must be assigned |
| AN (Analyst) | 0 | — | One or more expected before evidence work |
| QA (QA Reviewer) | 1 | — | Required before P2 |
| IR (Independent Referencer) | 0 | — | Required before reference check |
| PC (Publishing Coordinator) | 0 | 2 | Optional; needed before P4 |
| AL (Acceptance Lead) | 0 | — | May be assigned for visibility |
| RO (Read-Only Stakeholder) | 0 | — | View access only |

**Validation:**
- A user may hold more than one role on the same engagement.
- The same user-role combination may not be duplicated on the same engagement.
- The selected user must be an active account.
- Only an EM or AD may add team members.

**Error States:**

| Scenario | HTTP | Code | Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| Duplicate user-role assignment | 409 | `ASSIGNMENT_DUPLICATE` | "This user already holds this role on the engagement." |
| User not active | 422 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | "Selected user is not an active account." |
| Invalid role code | 422 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | "Role must be one of: AL, EM, AN, QA, IR, PC, RO." |
| Unauthorized | 403 | `FORBIDDEN` | "Only Engagement Managers may manage team assignments." |

---

### F05.2 Remove Team Members

**Roles permitted:** EM, AD

**Process:**
1. EM clicks Remove next to a team member.
2. System checks that removing the member does not violate minimum role requirements (e.g., cannot remove last EM).
3. System soft-deletes the `TeamAssignment` record (sets `removed_at`).
4. System writes audit event `TEAM_MEMBER_REMOVED`.

**Validation:**
- Cannot remove the last EM on an engagement.
- Cannot remove a QA Reviewer if P2 has not yet been approved (they are needed for the decision).

**Error States:**

| Scenario | HTTP | Code | Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| Removing last EM | 409 | `TEAM_MIN_VIOLATED` | "Cannot remove the last Engagement Manager from the team." |
| Removing QA Reviewer before P2 approved | 409 | `TEAM_ROLE_REQUIRED` | "Cannot remove the QA Reviewer before Gate P2 has been approved." |

---

### F05.3 Set Milestone Dates

**Roles permitted:** EM, AD

**Process:**
1. EM navigates to `/engagements/{id}/team` (milestone section).
2. EM enters or updates target dates for each milestone.
3. System validates dates.
4. System saves the milestone dates.
5. System writes audit event `MILESTONES_UPDATED`.

**Milestone definitions:**

| `evidence_readiness_target` | Evidence Readiness (P3) Target | Target date for Gate P3 approval |
| `draft_readiness_target` | Draft Readiness Target | Target date for draft product ready for review |
| `final_readiness_target` | Final Readiness (P4) Target | Target date for Gate P4 approval |

**Inputs:**
- Each milestone date: `date` field in `YYYY-MM-DD` format; nullable (not yet set = Not Started)

**Validation:**
- Milestone dates must be valid dates.
- `evidence_readiness_target` must be on or after `planning_approval_target` if both are set.
- `draft_readiness_target` must be on or after `evidence_readiness_target` if both are set.
- `final_readiness_target` must be on or after `draft_readiness_target` if both are set.

**Error States:**

| Scenario | HTTP | Code | Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| Invalid date format | 422 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | "Date must be in YYYY-MM-DD format." |
| Date ordering violation | 422 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | "Milestone dates must be in chronological order." |

---

### F05.4 View Milestone Status

**Milestone status is computed as follows:**

| Status | Condition |
|---|---|
| `not_started` | Target date is null |
| `on_track` | Target date is in the future and the associated gate has not passed |
| `at_risk` | Target date is within 7 days and the associated gate has not passed |
| `complete` | Associated gate has been approved |
| `overdue` | Target date is in the past and the associated gate has not passed |

The milestone status is displayed on the Engagement Shell (F04) and the Engagement Detail Dashboard (F15). Status is read-only (computed); the status field cannot be manually set by users except for milestones with no associated gate (computed by EM judgment, stored separately as `milestone_manual_status`).

## F06: Lightweight Planning Record

**Description:** The Lightweight Planning Record captures the planning baseline for an engagement: objectives, design approach, schedule notes, risk notes, data reliability notes, and independence affirmations. The record may be saved as a Draft at any time and submitted as Ready for Review when all required sections are complete. It becomes the baseline that Gate P2 locks. After P2 approval, edits require a revision note.

**Terminology:**
- **Draft:** Planning record saved but not yet submitted for P2 review.
- **Ready for Review:** Planning record submitted to the QA Reviewer's queue for P2 decision.
- **Approved:** Planning record locked after P2 approval; edits require a revision note.
- **Returned:** Planning record sent back by QA Reviewer with comments for revision.
- **Independence Affirmation:** A statement confirming that assigned team members have no conflict of interest for this engagement.
- **Revision Note:** A required comment explaining why an approved planning record is being modified.

**Sub-features:**
- F06.1 — Create planning record
- F06.2 — Add and manage objectives
- F06.3 — Complete planning sections
- F06.4 — Submit planning record for review
- F06.5 — Edit approved planning record (post-P2)

---

### F06.1 Create Planning Record

**Roles permitted:** EM, AN, AD

**Process:**
1. EM navigates to `/engagements/{id}/planning`.
2. If no planning record exists, system shows "Start Planning Record" button.
3. EM clicks button; system creates a planning record with `status = draft`.
4. System writes audit event `PLANNING_RECORD_CREATED`.

**Validation:**
- Only one planning record may exist per engagement.
- The engagement must have `status = active` and `phase` not `closed`.

---

### F06.2 Add and Manage Objectives

**Roles permitted:** EM, AN, AD (while planning record `status ≠ approved`; see F06.5 for post-approval)

**Process:**
1. User navigates to the planning record's Objectives section.
2. User clicks "Add Objective."
3. User enters objective text (required) and information need (optional).
4. System saves the objective linked to the planning record.
5. User may reorder objectives using sort order controls.
6. User may edit or delete objectives (deletion blocked if evidence is linked to the objective).

**Inputs (per objective):**
- `objective_text` (text, required): full text of the objective
- `information_need` (text, optional): what information is needed to address this objective
- `sort_order` (integer, optional): display ordering

**Validation:**
- `objective_text` must be non-empty.
- At least one objective must exist before the planning record can be submitted for P2 review.
- Deletion of an objective is blocked if any evidence item is linked to it.

**Error States:**

| Scenario | HTTP | Code | Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| Delete objective with linked evidence | 409 | `OBJECTIVE_HAS_EVIDENCE` | "Cannot delete this objective — it has linked evidence items. Unlink evidence first." |
| Objective text empty | 422 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | "Objective text is required." |

---

### F06.3 Complete Planning Sections

**Roles permitted:** EM, AN, AD (while `status ≠ approved`; see F06.5 for post-approval)

**Planning record fields and requirements:**

| No milestones set | 422 | `P2_PREREQUISITE_FAILED` | "At least one milestone date must be set before submitting for P2." |

---

### F06.5 Edit Approved Planning Record (Post-P2)

**Roles permitted:** EM, AD

**Process:**
1. After P2 approval, all planning record fields are locked in the UI.
2. EM clicks "Request Revision."
3. System prompts for a `revision_note` (required, minimum 10 characters).
4. After confirming, EM may edit the planning record fields.
5. Changes are saved; `status` remains `approved` but a `PlanningRevision` record is created with the revision note and before/after snapshot.
6. System writes audit event `PLANNING_RECORD_REVISED`.

**Inputs:**
- `revision_note` (string, required, min 10 chars): explains why the approved baseline is being changed

**Validation:**
- `revision_note` must be non-empty and at least 10 characters.
- Revisions to an approved planning record do not reset the gate to P2 unless the EM explicitly requests re-review.

## F07: Planning Approval — Gate P2

**Description:** Gate P2 is the planning governance checkpoint. A QA Reviewer reviews the planning record for completeness and either approves the baseline or returns it with comments for revision. Approval locks the planning baseline and advances the engagement to the evidence phase. Return keeps the record in a returned state with comments visible to the Engagement Manager for revision.

**Terminology:**
- **P2 Approval:** Gate outcome that locks the planning baseline; sets `planning_record.status = approved` and advances engagement phase to `evidence`.
- **P2 Return:** Gate outcome that sends the planning record back for revision; sets `planning_record.status = returned`.
- **Locked Baseline:** A planning record that has been P2-approved; subsequent edits require a revision note (see F06.5).

**Sub-features:**
- F07.1 — Review planning record for P2
- F07.2 — Approve planning baseline (Gate P2 pass)
- F07.3 — Return planning record for revision (Gate P2 return)
- F07.4 — P2 gate decision visibility

---

### F07.1 Review Planning Record for P2

**Roles permitted:** QA only

**Process:**
1. QA Reviewer navigates to Review Queue and selects a planning record with `status = ready_for_review`.
2. System displays the full planning record: design approach, schedule notes, risk notes, data reliability notes, independence status, objectives list, team assignment summary, milestone dates.
3. System displays the P2 prerequisite checklist (all items must be checked to approve).
4. QA Reviewer reads the record and decides to approve or return.

**P2 prerequisite checklist (all must be satisfied for approval):**
- [ ] At least one objective exists with `objective_text` non-empty.
- [ ] `risk_notes` is non-null and non-empty.
- [ ] `data_reliability_notes` is non-null and non-empty.
- [ ] `independence_status` is set to `affirmed`, `pending`, or `exception_noted`.
- [ ] Engagement has an owner assigned (`engagement.owner_id` is non-null).
- [ ] At least one team member with role `EM` is assigned.
- [ ] At least one milestone date is set.

---

### F07.2 Approve Planning Baseline — Gate P2 Pass

**Roles permitted:** QA only

**Process:**
1. QA Reviewer confirms all prerequisite items are satisfied.
2. QA Reviewer enters an approval comment (required).
3. QA Reviewer clicks "Approve."

## F08: Evidence Registry

**Description:** The Evidence Registry allows Analysts to create evidence records and upload supporting files for an engagement. Each evidence item captures provenance metadata (type, source, date received, custodian, description) and a sensitivity flag. Evidence items form the traceable foundation that findings, indexing, and reference checks rely on. One or more files may be attached to a single evidence item.

**Terminology:**
- **Evidence Item:** The metadata record for a single piece of evidence (document, dataset, interview note, etc.).
- **Evidence File:** One or more uploaded files attached to an evidence item; stored in file storage.
- **Custodian:** The person, office, or system that provided or holds the original evidence.
- **Restricted Evidence:** Evidence with `sensitivity = restricted`; viewable only by authorized roles on the engagement.
- **Standard Evidence:** Evidence with `sensitivity = standard`; viewable by all roles assigned to the engagement.

**Sub-features:**
- F08.1 — Create evidence record
- F08.2 — Upload evidence files
- F08.3 — Edit evidence record
- F08.4 — View evidence list
- F08.5 — Download evidence files
- F08.6 — Delete evidence record

## F09: Evidence-to-Objective Link

**Description:** Evidence-to-Objective Link allows users to associate evidence items with one or more planning objectives, establishing the traceability chain from objectives through evidence. Users can view which objectives have linked evidence and identify gaps (objectives with no evidence). A gap view highlights objectives still marked `evidence_needed`. The evidence registry can be exported to CSV.

**Terminology:**
- **Objective-Evidence Link:** The many-to-many association between an evidence item and an objective.
- **Gap View:** A filtered display showing objectives that have no linked evidence items; these are blockers for Gate P3.
- **Evidence Gap:** An objective with zero linked evidence items, or an objective whose status is still `evidence_needed`.

**Sub-features:**
- F09.1 — Link evidence to objectives
- F09.2 — Unlink evidence from objectives
- F09.3 — View linked evidence per objective
- F09.4 — Gap view (objectives without evidence)
- F09.5 — Export evidence registry to CSV

---

### F09.1 Link Evidence to Objectives

**Roles permitted:** AN, EM, AD
> Note: EM is permitted to link evidence to objectives (in addition to AN) to allow Engagement Managers to close coverage gaps during evidence review without depending on analyst availability. This is intentional. RO and AL cannot link evidence.

**Process:**
1. AN navigates to the evidence item detail page or the objectives page.
2. AN selects one or more objectives to link to the evidence item.
3. System validates that each selected objective belongs to the same engagement.
4. System creates an `ObjectiveEvidenceLink` record for each pairing.
5. System writes audit event `EVIDENCE_OBJECTIVE_LINKED` for each new link.

**Inputs:**
- `evidence_item_id` (UUID, required)
- `objective_ids` (array of UUIDs, required, min 1)

**Validation:**
- Evidence item must belong to the same engagement as the selected objectives.
- A link between a specific evidence item and objective may not be duplicated.
- Evidence item must not be deleted.
- Objective must not be deleted.

**Error States:**

| Scenario | HTTP | Code | Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| Evidence item not in same engagement | 422 | `CROSS_ENGAGEMENT_LINK` | "Evidence item does not belong to this engagement." |
| Duplicate link | 409 | `LINK_DUPLICATE` | "This evidence item is already linked to this objective." |
| Objective not found | 404 | `NOT_FOUND` | "Objective not found." |
| Unauthorized | 403 | `FORBIDDEN` | "You do not have permission to link evidence." |

---

### F09.2 Unlink Evidence from Objectives

**Roles permitted:** AN, EM, AD

**Process:**
1. User navigates to the objective or evidence item detail and clicks "Remove Link."
2. System checks that removing the link will not leave a finding with zero evidence links (see F10 Finding rules).
3. System deletes the `ObjectiveEvidenceLink` record.
4. System writes audit event `EVIDENCE_OBJECTIVE_UNLINKED`.

**Validation:**
- Cannot unlink if the evidence item is the only linked evidence for a finding that has `status ≠ draft` (protecting findings already under review).

**Error States:**

| Scenario | HTTP | Code | Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| Would leave finding with no evidence | 409 | `FINDING_EVIDENCE_REQUIRED` | "Cannot unlink — this evidence is the only link for a finding that is under review or accepted." |

---

### F09.3 View Linked Evidence Per Objective

**Roles permitted:** All roles assigned to engagement; AD

**Display:**
- For each objective in the planning record, show the list of linked evidence items.
- For each linked evidence item, display: evidence ID (short), type, source, date received, sensitivity badge.
- Access control: Restricted evidence items follow the same access rules as F08.4.

**Evidence item columns in objective view:**
- Evidence ID
- Evidence type
- Source
- Date received
- Sensitivity (`Standard` or `Restricted`)
- Linked findings count

---

### F09.4 Gap View (Objectives Without Evidence)

**Roles permitted:** All roles assigned to engagement; AD

**Process:**
1. User navigates to `/engagements/{id}/evidence/gaps` or uses the "Show Gaps" toggle on the objectives page.
2. System queries objectives where no `ObjectiveEvidenceLink` exists.
3. System displays objectives with zero linked evidence items and their current status.

**Displayed columns:**
- Objective text (truncated at 100 chars)
- Objective status (Evidence Needed / In Review / Sufficient)
- Number of linked evidence items (0 shown as badge "No Evidence")
- Days until evidence readiness milestone (if set)

**Business rule:** Any objective shown in the gap view with `status = evidence_needed` is a P3 blocker (see F10).

---

### F09.5 Export Evidence Registry to CSV

**Roles permitted:** AL, EM, AN, QA, PC, RO, AD

**Process:**
1. User navigates to the evidence page and clicks "Export to CSV."
2. System collects all non-deleted evidence items for the engagement.
3. System applies access control: Restricted items are excluded for AL and RO users.
4. System generates a CSV file.
5. System writes audit event `EVIDENCE_CSV_EXPORTED`.

**CSV columns:**
`Evidence ID, Evidence Type, Source, Date Received, Custodian, Description, Sensitivity, Linked Objectives, Files Attached, Uploaded By, Created Date`

**Validation:**
- Export is scoped to the current engagement only.
- IR users are not included in the export permission (they perform reference checks, not evidence management).

## F10: Findings and Sufficiency — Gate P3

**Description:** Gate P3 is the evidence readiness checkpoint. Analysts create finding records and link them to evidence items. QA Reviewers assess each objective's evidence status and mark them as Evidence Needed, In Review, or Sufficient. Gate P3 can only be approved when no objective has an evidence gap and no objective remains marked Evidence Needed. P3 approval records the QA Reviewer as approver and advances the engagement phase to `draft`.

**Terminology:**
- **Finding:** A draft conclusion or observation record linked to one or more evidence items.
- **Objective Status:** The current evidence readiness state for an objective: `evidence_needed`, `in_review`, or `sufficient`.
- **Evidence Gap:** An objective with zero linked evidence items.
- **P3 Approval:** The gate outcome confirming evidence is sufficient for all objectives; advances engagement to draft phase.

**Sub-features:**
- F10.1 — Create finding record
- F10.2 — Link finding to evidence items
- F10.3 — Update objective evidence status
- F10.4 — Approve evidence sufficiency (Gate P3 pass)
- F10.5 — P3 gate decision visibility

|---|---|---|---|
| Finding text empty | 422 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | "Finding text is required." |
| Wrong phase | 409 | `PHASE_PREREQUISITE_FAILED` | "Findings can only be created after planning has been approved (P2)." |
| Unauthorized | 403 | `FORBIDDEN` | "Only Analysts may create findings." |

---

### F10.2 Link Finding to Evidence Items

**Roles permitted:** AN, AD

**Process:**
1. AN opens the finding detail page.
2. AN selects one or more evidence items to link to the finding.
3. System validates that evidence items belong to the same engagement.
4. System creates `FindingEvidenceLink` records.
5. System writes audit event `FINDING_EVIDENCE_LINKED`.

**Inputs:**
- `finding_id` (UUID, required)
- `evidence_item_ids` (array of UUIDs, required, min 1)

**Validation:**
- Each evidence item must belong to the same engagement as the finding.
- A finding may not duplicate the same evidence link.
- A finding must have at least one linked evidence item before Gate P3 can pass.

**Business Rule:** Each finding must link to at least one evidence item before final readiness (P3 prerequisite).

**Roles permitted:** QA, EM, AD

**Process:**
1. QA Reviewer navigates to the objectives page for the engagement.
2. QA Reviewer reviews the linked evidence for each objective.
3. QA Reviewer updates the `status` field for each objective.
4. System validates the status transition.
5. System saves the update and writes audit event `OBJECTIVE_STATUS_UPDATED`.

**Allowed status values:**
- `evidence_needed` — No sufficient evidence yet; this is a P3 blocker.
- `in_review` — Evidence has been submitted and is under review.
- `sufficient` — QA confirms evidence is sufficient for this objective.

**Status transition rules:**
- `evidence_needed` → `in_review`: allowed when at least one evidence item is linked.

## F11: Draft Product Record

**Description:** The Draft Product Record is a simple record tied to an engagement that tracks the working draft product through review stages before reference check and final readiness. It captures draft title, version, owner, status, attached file or notes, and reviewer comments. The draft product bridges findings work (P3) and the reference check + final readiness (P4) workflow.

**Terminology:**
- **Draft Product:** The primary work product of the engagement in working form, not yet through reference check or final review.
- **Draft Status:** Current stage of the draft: `drafting`, `under_review`, `ready_for_reference_check`, or `ready_for_final_review`.
- **Draft File:** An attached file (e.g., a report draft document) uploaded to the draft product record.
- **Review Comments:** Inline or block comments recorded by the reviewer during the Under Review stage.

**Sub-features:**
- F11.1 — Create draft product record
- F11.2 — Edit draft product record
- F11.3 — Attach draft file
- F11.4 — Record review comments
- F11.5 — Advance draft status

## F12: Basic Indexing and Reference Check

**Description:** Basic Indexing and Reference Check allows Analysts to create draft statement records for the draft product and link each statement to supporting evidence items (indexing). Independent Referencers then verify each indexed statement against the linked evidence and mark reference status. Failed reference checks are assigned back to Analysts for correction. All reference checks must be Passed or explicitly Waived before Gate P4 can proceed.

**Terminology:**
- **Draft Statement:** A single claim, finding, or assertion in the draft product that requires evidence support; the unit of indexing.
- **Indexing:** The act of linking a draft statement to one or more evidence items.
- **Reference Check:** The Independent Referencer's review confirming whether the statement is supported by the linked evidence.
- **Reference Status:** Current state of the reference check for a statement: `not_started`, `in_review`, `passed`, `failed`, `waived`.
- **Discrepancy:** A noted inconsistency between the statement and the linked evidence, recorded when status is `failed`.
- **Waived:** A reference check explicitly skipped with a recorded justification (only permitted by EM or AD).

**Sub-features:**
- F12.1 — Create draft statement (index)
- F12.2 — Link statement to evidence items
- F12.3 — Assign reference check to Independent Referencer
- F12.4 — Perform reference check
- F12.5 — Record discrepancy and assign back to Analyst
- F12.6 — Waive reference check
- F12.7 — View reference check progress

---

### F12.1 Create Draft Statement (Index)

**Roles permitted:** AN, EM, AD

**Process:**
1. AN navigates to `/engagements/{id}/draft/statements` and clicks "Add Statement."
2. AN enters statement text (required).
3. AN saves the statement.
4. System creates the statement record with `reference_status = not_started`.
5. System writes audit event `STATEMENT_CREATED`.

**Inputs:**
- `draft_product_id` (UUID, required): from route
- `statement_text` (text, required): the full text of the draft statement
- `sort_order` (integer, optional): display order within the draft product

**Validation:**
- `statement_text` must be non-empty.
- The draft product must exist for this engagement.
- Statements may be created while draft product status is `drafting`, `under_review`, or `ready_for_reference_check`.

**Error States:**

| Scenario | HTTP | Code | Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| Statement text empty | 422 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | "Statement text is required." |
| Draft product not found | 404 | `NOT_FOUND` | "Draft product not found for this engagement." |
| Unauthorized | 403 | `FORBIDDEN` | "Only Analysts or Engagement Managers may create draft statements." |

---

### F12.2 Link Statement to Evidence Items

**Roles permitted:** AN, EM, AD

**Process:**
1. AN selects one or more evidence items to link to the statement.
2. System validates evidence items belong to the same engagement.
3. System creates `StatementEvidenceLink` records.
4. System writes audit event `STATEMENT_EVIDENCE_LINKED`.

**Inputs:**
- `statement_id` (UUID, required)
- `evidence_item_ids` (array of UUIDs, required, min 1)

**Validation:**
- Each evidence item must belong to the same engagement.
- A statement may not duplicate the same evidence link.
- A statement must have at least one evidence link before its reference check can begin.

**Error States:**

| Scenario | HTTP | Code | Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| Evidence from different engagement | 422 | `CROSS_ENGAGEMENT_LINK` | "Evidence item does not belong to this engagement." |
| Duplicate link | 409 | `LINK_DUPLICATE` | "This evidence item is already linked to this statement." |

---

### F12.3 Assign Reference Check to Independent Referencer

**Roles permitted:** EM, AD

**Process:**
1. EM navigates to the statement list and selects statements to assign.
2. EM selects an IR user from the engagement team.
3. System updates `statement.assigned_to_ir = user_id`, sets `reference_status = not_started` (if not already).
4. System writes audit event `REFERENCE_CHECK_ASSIGNED`.

**Validation:**
- The assigned user must have role `IR` and be assigned to this engagement.
- Statements without evidence links cannot be assigned for reference check.

**Error States:**

| Scenario | HTTP | Code | Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| Assigned user not IR | 422 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | "Assigned user must have the Independent Referencer role." |
| Statement has no evidence links | 422 | `REFERENCE_CHECK_PREREQ` | "Statement must be linked to at least one evidence item before reference check can begin." |

---

### F12.4 Perform Reference Check

**Roles permitted:** IR only

**Process:**
1. IR navigates to the Review Queue and selects assigned statements.
2. IR opens a statement, reviews the linked evidence, and assesses whether the statement is supported.
3. IR sets the `reference_status`:
   - `passed`: statement is supported by the linked evidence.
   - `failed`: statement is not adequately supported; IR records discrepancy notes.
   - `in_review`: IR has started review but has not yet completed the assessment.
4. System saves the status change.
5. System writes audit event `REFERENCE_STATUS_CHANGED`.

**Inputs:**
- `statement_id` (UUID, required)
- `reference_status` (enum, required): `in_review` | `passed` | `failed`
- `discrepancy_notes` (text, required if `reference_status = failed`): description of the issue

1. AN sees failed reference checks in their queue.
2. AN updates the draft statement text or its evidence links to address the discrepancy.
3. AN changes the statement status to indicate revision is ready (sets `revision_ready = true`).
4. IR is notified (via Review Queue) that the statement is ready for re-check.
5. IR re-performs the reference check (F12.4).

---

### F12.6 Waive Reference Check

**Roles permitted:** EM, AD only

**Process:**
1. EM identifies a statement where reference check will not be performed (e.g., well-established fact requiring no citation).
2. EM clicks "Waive Reference Check" and enters a waiver justification (required).
3. System sets `reference_status = waived`, records `waived_by`, `waived_at`, `waiver_justification`.
4. System writes audit event `REFERENCE_CHECK_WAIVED`.

**Inputs:**
- `statement_id` (UUID, required)
- `waiver_justification` (string, required, min 10 chars)

**Validation:**
- Only EM or AD may waive.
- Waiver justification must be non-empty (minimum 10 characters).

**Error States:**

| Scenario | HTTP | Code | Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| Waiver justification missing | 422 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | "Waiver justification is required." |

## F13: Final Readiness — Gate P4

**Description:** Gate P4 is the terminal governance checkpoint. It confirms that all reference checks are complete (Passed or Waived), no open blockers remain, and the final review has been completed. On approval, the engagement status transitions to `ready_for_issuance`. An optional close path sets the engagement to `closed`. All P4 decisions create an immutable audit event.

**Terminology:**
- **Final Readiness Checklist:** The computed list of P4 prerequisites displayed to the approver before they can submit the gate decision.
- **Ready for Issuance:** The engagement status after P4 approval, indicating the draft product is approved for issuance.
- **Closed:** An engagement status indicating the engagement was terminated or concluded without issuance.
- **Open Blocker:** Any unresolved prerequisite condition that prevents P4 from passing.

**Sub-features:**
- F13.1 — Display final readiness checklist
- F13.2 — Approve final readiness (Gate P4 pass)
- F13.3 — Close engagement without issuance
- F13.4 — P4 gate decision visibility

---

### F13.1 Display Final Readiness Checklist

**Roles permitted:** EM, PC, QA, AD (view); EM, PC, AD (initiate approval)

**Process:**
1. EM or PC navigates to `/engagements/{id}/gates/p4`.
2. System computes and displays the P4 prerequisite checklist with pass/fail indicators for each item.

**P4 Prerequisite Checklist (all must be ✓ before approval is enabled):**

| # | Check | Pass Condition |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Gate P3 approved | A `GateDecision` with `gate_type = P3`, `status = approved` exists for this engagement |
| 2 | No reference checks `failed` | Count of `draft_statements` with `reference_status = failed` = 0 |
| 3 | No reference checks `in_review` | Count of `draft_statements` with `reference_status = in_review` = 0 |
| 4 | No reference checks `not_started` (unwaived) | Count of `draft_statements` with `reference_status = not_started` = 0 |
| 5 | No open blockers | All blocker conditions in F04.4 are cleared |

**Display behavior:**
- Each checklist item shows a green ✓ (pass) or red ✗ (fail) indicator.
- For each failing item, a brief explanation and a link to the affected records is shown.
- The "Approve P4" button is disabled until all items are ✓.

---

### F13.2 Approve Final Readiness — Gate P4 Pass

**Roles permitted:** EM, PC, AD

**Process:**
1. Approver confirms the P4 checklist is fully satisfied (all items ✓).
2. Approver enters final approval comment (required).
3. Approver selects outcome: "Ready for Issuance" or "Closed" (EM/AD only; PC always approves as Ready for Issuance).
4. Approver clicks "Approve P4."
5. System validates all P4 prerequisites server-side.
6. System creates a `GateDecision` record:  
   - `gate_type = P4`, `status = approved`, `approver_id`, `decided_at = now()`, `rationale`
7. System updates `engagement.status`:
   - If outcome = "Ready for Issuance": `status = ready_for_issuance`
   - If outcome = "Closed": `status = closed`
8. System updates `engagement.phase = readiness` (terminal phase for issuance path) or `phase = closed` (for closed path).
9. System writes audit event `GATE_P4_APPROVED`.

**Prerequisite Validation Rules (server-side, all must pass):**
- A `GateDecision` with `gate_type = P3`, `status = approved` must exist for this engagement.
- Count of `draft_statements` with `reference_status = failed` must be **zero**.
- Count of `draft_statements` with `reference_status = in_review` must be **zero**.
- Count of `draft_statements` with `reference_status = not_started` must be **zero**.
- No open blocker conditions exist (see F04.4 blocker computation).
- `rationale` must be non-null and non-empty (minimum 10 characters).

**Inputs:**
- `engagement_id` (UUID, required): from route
- `rationale` (string, required, min 10 chars): final approval comment
- `outcome` (enum, required): `ready_for_issuance` | `closed`

**Outputs:**
- `GateDecision` record (`gate_type = P4`, `status = approved`)
- `engagement.status` updated to `ready_for_issuance` or `closed`
- `engagement.phase` updated
- Audit event `GATE_P4_APPROVED`

**Error States:**

| Scenario | HTTP | Code | Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| P3 not approved | 409 | `GATE_PREREQUISITE_FAILED` | "Gate P3 must be approved before P4 can pass." |
| Reference checks still `failed` | 409 | `GATE_PREREQUISITE_FAILED` | "All reference checks must be Passed or Waived. {n} check(s) have Failed status." |
| Reference checks still `in_review` | 409 | `GATE_PREREQUISITE_FAILED` | "All reference checks must be Passed or Waived. {n} check(s) are still In Review." |
| Reference checks still `not_started` | 409 | `GATE_PREREQUISITE_FAILED` | "All reference checks must be Passed or Waived. {n} check(s) have not been started." |
| Open blockers exist | 409 | `GATE_PREREQUISITE_FAILED` | "Open blockers must be resolved before P4 can pass." |
| Rationale missing | 422 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | "Final approval comment is required." |
| Invalid outcome value | 422 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | "Outcome must be one of: ready_for_issuance, closed." |
| Unauthorized role | 403 | `FORBIDDEN` | "Only an Engagement Manager or Publishing Coordinator may approve Gate P4." |

---

### F13.3 Close Engagement Without Issuance

**Roles permitted:** EM, AD

There are two paths to close an engagement that will not be issued:

**Path A — Close via P4 approval outcome (after P3 is approved):**
1. During F13.2, EM or AD selects "Closed" as the outcome instead of "Ready for Issuance."
2. All P4 prerequisite checks still apply (P3 approved, no failed/in-review/not-started checks, no open blockers).
3. System creates a `GateDecision` (gate_type=P4, status=approved, outcome=closed) and writes audit event `GATE_P4_APPROVED`.
4. System sets `engagement.status = closed` and `engagement.phase = closed`.

**Path B — Direct close without completing P4 (at any phase before `ready_for_issuance`):**
1. EM uses the "Close Engagement" action on the engagement shell.
2. EM enters a close rationale (minimum 10 characters).
3. System does NOT require P3/P4 gates to be passed; this path is for engagements abandoned before completion.
4. System sets `engagement.status = closed` and `engagement.phase = closed`.
5. System writes audit event `ENGAGEMENT_CLOSED` (distinct from `GATE_P4_APPROVED`).

**In both paths:** A closed engagement is read-only. No further edits, uploads, or gate approvals are permitted. All records and audit history remain visible.

**Error States (Path B):**

| Scenario | HTTP | Code | Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rationale missing or too short | 422 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | "Close rationale must be at least 10 characters." |
| Engagement already closed or ready for issuance | 409 | `INVALID_STATUS_TRANSITION` | "Engagement is already closed or has been issued." |
| Unauthorized | 403 | `FORBIDDEN` | "Only an Engagement Manager may close an engagement." |

---

### F13.4 P4 Gate Decision Visibility

- P4 gate decision is shown on the Engagement Shell gate status card.
- The final outcome (`ready_for_issuance` or `closed`) is displayed as the engagement status badge.
- The engagement register and portfolio dashboard reflect the updated status immediately.
- Gate P4 approval records are immutable and permanently visible in the audit trail.
- After P4 approval, the engagement enters a read-only state; no workflow changes can be initiated.

### F16.4 Journey-to-Gate Scenario Mapping

Key gate scenarios derived from journeys, used as the basis for F17 acceptance tests:

| Scenario ID | Journey | Gate | Positive Path | Negative Path |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S-A1-APPROVE | J1 | A1 | All request fields present + risk level + rationale → Engagement Shell created | Missing required field → 422 blocked |
| S-A1-DECLINE | J1 | A1 | Rationale provided → Request closed | Missing rationale → 422 blocked |
| S-P2-APPROVE | J2 | P2 | ≥1 objective + risk notes + data reliability + independence + owner + team + milestones → Planning approved | Missing any prerequisite → blocked |
| S-P2-RETURN | J2 | P2 | QA enters return comment → Planning returned | Missing comment → 422 blocked |
| S-P3-APPROVE | J3 | P3 | All objectives sufficient + no gaps + all findings linked → P3 approved | Any objective `evidence_needed` → blocked |
| S-P4-APPROVE | J5 | P4 | P3 approved + all checks Passed/Waived + no blockers → P4 approved | Any `failed` or `in_review` → blocked |

---

**Note:** Persona and journey artifacts are specification/design artifacts. They are maintained in this document and referenced by F17 for acceptance test generation. No database storage is required for persona definitions in v1.

**API Surface (F16):** None required. Personas and journeys are static specification artifacts.  
**Schema Surface (F16):** No dedicated tables. Journey scenarios feed into F17 test cases.
---

## F17: Basic Acceptance Test Generation

**Description:** Basic Acceptance Test Generation produces a compact set of acceptance tests derived from the primary journeys (J1–J5) and gate prerequisite rules. These tests validate the core workflow behaviors — request submission, gate approval/rejection, evidence upload, reference check completion, dashboard visibility, and CSV export — to confirm the system is correctly implemented.

**Terminology:**
- **Acceptance Test:** A named test with a precondition, action, and expected outcome that validates a specific behavior.
- **Gate Rule Test:** A test that specifically validates a gate's prerequisite enforcement (must block when conditions are not met; must pass when they are).
- **Positive Path Test:** Validates that the happy path works correctly.
- **Negative Path Test:** Validates that the system correctly blocks or rejects an action that does not meet prerequisites.

**Sub-features:**
- F17.1 — Request submission and A1 gate tests
- F17.2 — Engagement setup and P2 gate tests
- F17.3 — Evidence upload and P3 gate tests
- F17.4 — Reference check and P4 gate tests
- F17.5 — Dashboard visibility and CSV export tests

## Y0: Database Schema — Full DDL

All tables use PostgreSQL-compatible syntax. UUIDs are generated by `gen_random_uuid()`. All timestamps are `TIMESTAMPTZ` (UTC). Soft-delete columns (`deleted_at`) are used where specified.

## Y3: External Integration Points

This document catalogs all external system dependencies and integration contracts for EMS v1. The scope is intentionally minimal; advanced integrations are explicitly deferred.

---

### §File Storage

**Purpose:** Store intake documents (F02), evidence files (F08), and draft product attachments (F11).

**Integration type:** Object storage (local filesystem for development; managed blob storage for production, e.g., S3-compatible, Azure Blob, or GCS).

**Contract:**

| Operation | Trigger | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Upload file | POST to file endpoint | System writes file to storage path; records `file_ref` (path/URL) and `file_name` in database |
| Download file | GET file endpoint | System checks authorization; returns signed/authenticated URL or streams file content |
| Delete file | Engagement soft-delete cleanup | Physical delete is deferred; scheduled cleanup process marks orphan files for removal |

**Storage path conventions:**

| Use case | Path |
|---|---|
| Intake document | `requests/{request_id}/{original_filename}` |
| Evidence file | `evidence/{engagement_id}/{evidence_id}/{original_filename}` |
| Draft attachment | `draft/{engagement_id}/{draft_id}/{original_filename}` |

**Configuration:**
- Storage backend is configurable via environment variables: `STORAGE_BACKEND` (`local` or `s3_compatible`), `STORAGE_BUCKET`, `STORAGE_BASE_PATH`.
- For local development: files are stored on the local filesystem at `./data/files/`.
- For production: S3-compatible bucket with server-side encryption required.

**Security requirements:**
- Files must not be publicly accessible by direct URL.
- Access must be granted only through the application API after RBAC check.
- Restricted evidence files must be additionally filtered by `sensitivity` check before the download URL is issued.

---

### §Authentication Provider

**Purpose:** Authenticate users before granting access to the application.

**Integration type:** Built-in username/password authentication (v1 default). Organization identity provider (OIDC/SAML) is a future option; not in scope for v1.

**Contract (v1 — built-in auth):**
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt (cost factor ≥ 12).
- Sessions are stored in the `sessions` table with an expiry of 8 hours (configurable).
- Login attempts are tracked in `login_attempts`; account is locked after 5 consecutive failures within 15 minutes.
- Lockout duration: 15 minutes (configurable via environment variable).

**Future provision:** The authentication layer should be designed so that an OIDC/SAML provider can be substituted by updating the auth configuration without changing feature logic.

---

### §CSV Export

**Purpose:** Export engagement register (F14) and evidence registry (F09) to CSV for stakeholder reporting.

**Integration type:** Server-generated CSV download (no external system).

**Contract:**
- Server generates CSV in memory from database query and streams the response with `Content-Type: text/csv` and `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="{type}_{engagement_id}_{date}.csv"`.
- No third-party CSV library required beyond standard language library.
- Export is triggered by `Accept: text/csv` header or a `?format=csv` query parameter on the relevant GET endpoint.

---

### §Email / Notifications

**Scope in v1:** Out of scope. No email or push notification integration.

**Provision:** The system should write audit events for all actions that would logically trigger notifications (gate returns, reference check failures, assignments). A future notification module can consume the audit event stream to send emails.

---

### §HTTPS / TLS

**Requirement:** All application traffic must use HTTPS/TLS.

**Implementation:** TLS termination is handled at the load balancer or reverse proxy (e.g., nginx, AWS ALB) in front of the application container. The application itself runs on HTTP internally within the container network.

---

### §Database

**Integration type:** PostgreSQL (recommended) or equivalent relational database.

**Version:** PostgreSQL 15+ recommended for `gen_random_uuid()` and `JSONB` support.

**Connection:** Application connects via connection string in environment variable `DATABASE_URL`.

**Backup:** Database backup must be supported using standard pg_dump tooling or cloud snapshot. Backup schedule is configurable by the deployment operator.

---

### §Deployment and Container

**Integration type:** Docker container + docker-compose for local development; container orchestration (Kubernetes or equivalent) for production.

**Required services (docker-compose):**
- `app` — Backend REST API service
- `frontend` — React web application
- `db` — PostgreSQL instance
- `storage` — Local file storage volume (or external storage mount)

**Environment variables (required at startup):**

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Secret key for session signing |
| `STORAGE_BACKEND` | `local` or `s3_compatible` |
| `STORAGE_BUCKET` | Bucket name (if s3_compatible) |
| `STORAGE_BASE_PATH` | Base path for file storage |
| `MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` | Failed login threshold (default 5) |
| `LOCKOUT_DURATION_MINUTES` | Account lockout duration (default 15) |
| `SESSION_EXPIRY_HOURS` | Session duration (default 8) |

---

### §Out-of-Scope Integrations (Explicitly Deferred for v1)

| Integration | Reason Deferred |
|---|---|
| External records management system | Out of scope — full records management not required |
| Email/push notifications | Deferred; audit events provision for future module |
| Organization identity provider (OIDC/SAML) | Deferred to post-MVP; built-in auth sufficient for v1 |
| Advanced analytics / BI tool | Out of scope — CSV export is sufficient for v1 reporting |
| External publication/workflow system | Out of scope — P4 is the terminal point for this version |
| Recommendation tracking system | Out of scope for v1 |
